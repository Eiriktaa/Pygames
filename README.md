# Pygames
A collection of pygame project done during autum semester IN1000 UIO 21 

## a*_pathfind
This is a visualisation tool to be able to understand the A* pathfinding algorithm

To use left-click on a tile to indicate it as the starting tile.
Then the following tile will be the target.
Any other tiles clicked will become obstacles. 
To clear a tile, simply right-click on it.

To run the simulation press space once a target and starting tile has been set.

## Saugame
This is a the final project for IN1000 UIO 21. 
The assignment was to create a sheep's brain that figures its way around in a random maze-like map. And eats as much grass as possible while avoids getting eaten by the wolf in the process.

This contribution uses a shortest path algorithm that also accounts for the wolfs current position and avoids paths that go close to the wolf 

To run: python hovedprogram.py

To see how it behaves on other courses edit line 11 in the same file.
